# using variables we can store data in variables and use them throughout our code.
var1 = "Jai"
print(var1)

name = (len(input("Your name is ")))
print(f"Length of your name is {name}")

# so thats how we use variables.

var1  = 50
print(var1)

var1 = 60
print(var1)

# whenever we overwrite varibale it will be overwritten and put new data in variables which we passed
